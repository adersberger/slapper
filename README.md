## Usage
```bash
$ ./slapper -help
Usage of ./slapper:
  -maxY duration
        max on Y axe (default 100ms)
  -minY duration
        min on Y axe (default 1ms)
  -rate int
        Requests per second (default 50)
  -targets string
        Targets file (default "stdin")
  -base64body bool
        Bodies in target file are base64-encoded (default false)
  -timeout duration
        Requests timeout (default 30s)
  -workers int
        Number of workers (default 8)
```

## Key bindings
* q, ctrl-c - quit
* r - reset stats
* k - increase rate by 100 RPS
* j - decrease rate by 100 RPS

## Targets syntax

The targets file is line-based. Its syntax is:

	HTTP_METHOD url
	$ body

The body line is optional. The rules for what is considered to be a body
line are:

1. If something starts with `$ ` (dollar-sign and space), it's a body
2. If the line is literally `{}`, it's an empty body

A missing body line is taken to mean an empty request body. Point (2) is there
for backwards-compatibility.
